1. merit mean? [14, 42]

2. amortized group fairness

3. dynamic LTR - ranking function adapt based on user feedback

4. controller problem, P controller

5. cardinal relevance estimator, ordinal [4, 33]

6. click models [19]

7. PBM position-based model [21], proved in [5, 33, 47]
estimate position bias [5, 23, 33, 47]
explicit and implicit swap interventions
contexture features in the PBM model, some queries useers may explore further down
users may not naturally explore low enough, to avoid zero examination propensities [27] need active interventions

skipping fairness part for now
